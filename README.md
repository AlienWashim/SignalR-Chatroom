# SignalR Chatroom
This chat room system project has been an incredible opportunity to dive deep into web development with the ASP.NET framework. The project involved creating a fully functional chat application where users can join, send messages, and interact with each other in real-time.

### 2. Chatroom Interface (After Joining)

Upon joining the chat room, the user is presented with an option to leave the chat. While in the chat, the user can send messages to all connected users and view messages from others in real-time. Once the user leaves the chat, they are automatically redirected to the About page for further information or navigation.

In the chat interface, hovering over a message reveals the time it was sent or received. Additionally, the system displays the user's joining and leaving time in real-time, ensuring seamless tracking of user activity during the chat session.
